      {answer : "Liquor refers to a distilled alcoholic spirit (vodka, whiskey, etc.), while a liqueur is a flavored spirit with at least 2.5 percent sugar by U.S. law. Liqueurs are usually lower in ABV and are called “cordials” in the UK.", userId: 1, cocktailQId: 1,  createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},
      {answer : "Both “ABV” and “proof” are terms that refer to the amount of pure alcohol in a spirit. ABV stands for “alcohol by volume,” which measures the amount of ethanol in a specific bottle of alcohol by percentage. The proof refers to the spirit’s alcohol content on a 0 to 200 scale. To calculate the 'proof' of a spirit, simply double the ABV. For example, if a rum is 50% ABV it would be 100-proof.", userId: 3, cocktailQId: 2,  createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},
      {answer : "When you order a spirit “neat,” it means you just want the booze poured straight into the glass with no ice or added flavorings. Ordering a drink “on the rocks” will get you a straight spirit or cocktail poured over ice in a lowball glass. Ordering a drink “up” means you want it chilled and strained without ice into a stemmed cocktail glass like a coupe. Don’t order a drink “straight up on the rocks” or you’ll confuse everyone.", userId: 5, cocktailQId: 3,  createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},
      {answer : "A highball and lowball usually refers to glassware. A highball glass is a tall, thin glass, and a lowball is a smaller, squat glass—also referred to as a rocks or old-fashioned glass. A highball can also refer to a type of drink, usually a basic mixture of a liquor and soda, like a Rum & Coke.", userId: 1, cocktailQId: 4,  createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},
      {answer : "Glasses serve very particular purposes, which is why cocktails usually call for a specific one. Highball glasses and Champagne flutes funnel the bubbles of soda up to the top, preventing it from going flat. The wide opening on a lowball glass opens up the aromas of a cocktail or spirit, and certain speciality whiskey glasses claim to further enhance the experience of drinking whiskey. Some mugs are designed to keep drinks hot, like an Irish Coffee, while a metal Mint Julep cup keeps the cocktail frosty. A Hurricane glass is big enough to fit all those tiki ingredients, and a coupe glass delicately holds any drink that is served up. Whatever you do, avoid the Martini glass—it’s an unwieldy, lesser coupe that deserves to die in a fire, in our humble opinion.", userId: 2, cocktailQId: 5,  createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},
      {answer : "Short answer: usually no. Most alcohol is shelf-stable and can be displayed on your bar cart without fear of spoiling. Most spirits do not go bad, though people sometimes store spirits like vodka in the fridge to avoid having to cool them with ABV-diluting ice. Cream-based liqueurs like Baileys are shelf-stable, but should be used within two years of opening. The notable exception to the rule is vermouth and other fortified wines. Just like a bottle of wine, an open bottle of vermouth should be stored in the fridge and used within two weeks of opening or it will turn—undoubtedly why so many people have a misinformed hatred of vermouth.", userId: 4, cocktailQId: 6,  createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},
      {answer : "Yes. Many people are afraid they’ll get salmonella if there are egg whites in their cocktail, but that is nearly impossible. Egg whites are shaken without ice very thoroughly in a cocktail, so that they emulsify. Agitating the whites causes their proteins to unfold and mixes in air bubbles, creating a nice foam for a cocktail that’s perfectly safe to drink.", userId: 4, cocktailQId: 7,  createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},
      {answer : "The difference in spelling indicates where the whiskey originated. Ireland and the United States (with a few exceptions) spell it “whiskey,” while pretty much the rest of the world—namely Scotland, Canada, Japan and India—spell it without the “e.”", userId: 5, cocktailQId: 8,  createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},
      {answer : "This is a matter of preference. Some people swear by drinking whiskey without even a drop of dilution, while others claim that a drop of water opens up whiskey’s aromas, making it more palatable. The type of water you use could even affect the whiskey. So, try it both ways and see which way you like it.", userId: 1, cocktailQId: 9,  createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},
      {answer : "Bitters are highly concentrated, potent flavoring agents made from steeping herbs, roots, citrus peels, seeds, spices, flowers and barks in high-proof alcohol. You only need to use a few dashes in a cocktail, but it will hugely affect the taste of your cocktail for the better. Contrary to the name, bitters do not actually make your drink taste bitter. When used in the right quantities, they can spice up a drink in all the right ways, especially if you use flavored ones like Tiki or orange bitters to compliment the flavors of your drink. You can use bitters to add complexity to a cocktail, as an aromatic garnish, or even as a curative elixir to help alleviate digestive issues and hiccups. You can even make your own bitters.", userId: 5, cocktailQId: 10,  createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},
      {answer : "When someone asks for a cocktail “with a twist,” they’re not asking for the bartender to surprise them. A twist refers to a swath of citrus peel—usually lemon, orange or grapefruit with no white pith—that’s twisted over a drink so that its zest is expressed, releasing a light and bright citrusy flavor into the cocktail.", userId: 1, cocktailQId: 11,  createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},
      {answer : "“Chaser” and “back” are synonymous, both referring to something taken after a shot of liquor, to dull the burning sensation and cleanse the palate. The most famous chaser is the Pickleback—a shot of pickle brine taken after a shot of whiskey, effectively nullifying the taste of the whiskey instantly. People commonly order water backs with a stiff drink, to switch between the hard stuff and some hydration.", userId: 2, cocktailQId: 12,  createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},
      {answer : "Technically, a Martini can be either shaken or stirred depending on your preference, but the classic way of preparing one is by stirring, which, in our opinion, yields the best balance. We feel personally victimized by James Bond for confusing the entire world on this matter.", userId: 2, cocktailQId: 13,  createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},
      {answer : "To muddle means to press ingredients against the base of the glass using a muddler, to extract the flavors from herbs like mint (in the case of a Mojito) or juice from fruits like limes (in the case of a Caipirinha).", userId: 5, cocktailQId: 14,  createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},
      {answer : "A nightcap isn’t a specific cocktail or even a particular type of drink—it simply refers to a drink that’s enjoyed at the tail end of an evening before bed. That said, classic nightcaps are usually digestifs meant to help soothe the tummy and mind before bed, like straight whiskey or Cognac.", userId: 3, cocktailQId: 15,  createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},
      {answer : "I trust my main man James Bond, shaken all the way!", userId: 1, cocktailQId: 13,  createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},

      {answer : "absolutely not!!!", userId: 1, cocktailQId: 9,  createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},
      {answer : "Water takes the bite out of whiskey without taking away from its flavor. It is good for people who are just starting to drink whiskey to help ease them in without the kick.", userId: 5, cocktailQId: 9,  createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},
      {answer : "Some people like to act fancy, so they use different glasses.", userId: 4, cocktailQId: 5,  createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},
